# I made this Quarto Presentation

I know actual convincing is needed....

# I am Very Inquisitive

**... and I Pay Attention to your Lectures**

Here is a random *interactive* graph that I made (all by myself)

```{r}
#| output: false
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)
library(gghighlight)
library(ISLR2)
library(openintro)
library(janitor)
library(gapminder)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggiraph)
library(snakecase)
```

```{r}
bmi_star <- starwars %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(weight_on_earth = mass * 9.8 * 0.10197) %>%
  mutate(height_in_mtrs = height/100) |>
  mutate(BMI = weight_on_earth / ((height_in_mtrs) * (height_in_mtrs))) %>%
  mutate(rem = case_when(
    BMI <= 18.5 ~ "should be sent to Nani ka ghar to gain weight",
    BMI > 18.5 & BMI <= 25 ~ "is healthy!",
    BMI > 25 & BMI <= 30 ~ "should be sent to gym",
    BMI > 30 ~ "? No comments."
  ))

bmi_star_graph <- bmi_star %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight_on_earth, y = height_in_mtrs, data_id = name, tooltip = paste(name, rem))) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(size = BMI, color = sex, data_id = name )) +
  labs(
    x = 'Weight on Earth (in kgs)',
    y = 'Height (in mtrs)',
    caption = '0% use of ChatGPT',
    title = 'If they were on Earth, what would be the BMI of the characters of Star Wars be?')

girafe(ggobj = bmi_star_graph, 
       options = list(opts_hover(css = ''),
                      opts_hover_inv(css = "opacity:0.1;"),
                      opts_sizing(rescale = FALSE)),
       height_svg = 5,
       width_svg = 10)

```

I try out new things from what I learn

# I am a Fan of Gurudas Sir

Sir took a few lectures of Environmental Economics, enjoyed every bit of it

Working with him would be very amazing

# I am Sincere 

One of my favourite things about me.

*Aisa koyi kaam nahi jo mujhe diya gaya ho aur maine nahi kiya!*

# I can make Dashboards as well!

..... is what I want to tell my cousin whose CV mentions 'dashboard'.

# I am Available for the Project

If I didn't love R or coding or learning new things, I wouldn't have made this presentation.

# Baaki Sab Aapke Haath Mein
